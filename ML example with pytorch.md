## I. Quick start of pytorch

Here's a quick start guide to get you started with PyTorch:

1. Install PyTorch:
   - You can install PyTorch using `pip` by running `pip install torch`.

2. Import the required libraries:
   - Import the `torch` library to access PyTorch functionalities.
   - Import other necessary libraries depending on your specific requirements, such as `torch.nn` for neural network modules and `torch.optim` for optimization algorithms.

3. Tensors:
   - PyTorch uses tensors as the fundamental data structure.
   - Create tensors using `torch.Tensor` or specific functions like `torch.zeros`, `torch.ones`, or `torch.randn`.
   - Tensors are similar to NumPy arrays and support similar operations.

4. Automatic Differentiation:
   - PyTorch provides automatic differentiation for computing gradients.
   - Enable automatic differentiation by setting the `requires_grad` attribute of tensors to `True`.
   - Use the `backward()` method to compute gradients and the `grad` attribute to access the gradients.

5. Neural Networks:
   - Define neural networks by creating classes that extend from `torch.nn.Module`.
   - In the `__init__` method of the class, define the layers and operations that make up the network.
   - Implement the forward pass in the `forward` method, where the input data is passed through the layers.

6. Optimizers and Loss Functions:
   - Instantiate an optimizer from `torch.optim` (e.g., `torch.optim.SGD` or `torch.optim.Adam`) and provide the network's parameters and learning rate.
   - Choose a suitable loss function from `torch.nn` (e.g., `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` or `torch.nn.MSELoss`).

7. Training Loop:
   - In a training loop, forward pass the input data through the network, compute the loss, and perform backward pass to compute gradients.
   - Use the optimizer to update the model's parameters using the gradients.
   - Repeat the process for multiple epochs to train the model.

Here's a simple example of a training loop in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define your neural network class
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Define your network layers here

    def forward(self, x):
        # Implement the forward pass

# Create an instance of your model
model = MyModel()

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

    # Backward pass and optimization
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    # Print the loss for monitoring progress

# Use the trained model for inference or further tasks
```

This is a basic overview of getting started with PyTorch. As you progress, you can explore more advanced features and techniques to build and train complex models. The official PyTorch documentation provides detailed information and tutorials to help you dive deeper into specific topics and functionalities.


## II. A simple example to build ML using pytorch 

Here are simple examples for each of the four machine learning tasks using PyTorch, including a brief explanation and code snippets for each.

An example to build ML using pytorch for:
1. Binary Classification
2. Multi-class classification
3. Regression
4. Recurrent Neural Network
5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
6. Bigram Language Model
7. Transformer Model

### Top 10 rows of example data for each type of machine learning task

1. Binary Classification:

   ```
   X          y
   -------------
   2.5, 1.2   0
   3.9, 0.8   0
   1.4, 1.6   1
   4.7, 1.9   0
   2.8, 0.5   1
   3.2, 1.1   1
   1.9, 0.7   0
   4.5, 1.5   1
   2.1, 0.9   0
   3.8, 1.3   1
   ```

2. Multi-class Classification:

   ```
   X          y
   -------------
   5.1, 3.5   0
   4.9, 3.0   0
   4.7, 3.2   1
   4.6, 3.1   1
   5.0, 3.6   2
   5.4, 3.9   2
   4.6, 3.4   0
   5.0, 3.4   1
   4.4, 2.9   2
   4.9, 3.1   0
   ```

3. Regression:

   ```
   X          y
   -------------
   1.2, 1.5   2.8
   3.1, 2.6   5.3
   2.3, 0.9   3.2
   1.8, 1.3   2.1
   2.6, 1.8   3.7
   3.5, 2.2   4.9
   1.7, 0.8   2.5
   3.0, 2.0   4.1
   2.1, 1.1   3.0
   2.8, 1.7   4.0
   ```

4. Recurrent Neural Network:

   ```
   X          y
   -------------
   0.2, 0.1   0.3
   0.3, 0.4   0.7
   0.1, 0.3   0.4
   0.4, 0.5   0.9
   0.3, 0.2   0.5
   0.5, 0.4   0.9
   0.2, 0.3   0.5
   0.4, 0.2   0.6
   0.3, 0.4   0.7
   0.4, 0.1   0.5
   ```

In an RNN, the input data typically includes sequences or time series data.

```
Sequence             Target
-----------------------------
0.2, 0.1, 0.3        0.4
0.5, 0.4, 0.2        0.6
0.3, 0.2, 0.1        0.4
0.4, 0.6, 0.5        0.8
0.1, 0.3, 0.2        0.4
0.2, 0.4, 0.3        0.6
0.5, 0.3, 0.4        0.7
0.3, 0.1, 0.2        0.4
0.2, 0.3, 0.5        0.6
0.4, 0.5, 0.6        0.9
```

In this example, the data consists of sequences of values in the "Sequence" column, and the corresponding target or output value in the "Target" column. Each sequence represents a time step, and the RNN model can learn patterns and relationships in the sequential data to make predictions.

**Notes:** Please note that this example is simplified for demonstration purposes. In real-world scenarios, time series data may have more features, longer sequences, and additional dimensions depending on the specific problem domain.

5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the input data is typically in the form of images. Each image is represented as a matrix of pixel values. Here's an example of how the data for a CNN might look like:

```
Image    Label
----------------
Image1   Cat
Image2   Dog
Image3   Dog
Image4   Cat
Image5   Cat
Image6   Dog
Image7   Cat
Image8   Dog
Image9   Dog
Image10  Cat
```

In this example, the dataset consists of images labeled as either "Cat" or "Dog". The "Image" column represents the image data, which could be a 2D or 3D array of pixel values depending on the color channels. The "Label" column indicates the corresponding class or category of each image.

It's important to note that the actual pixel values of the images are not shown here, but they would typically be numerical values representing the intensity or color information of each pixel. The dataset would typically include a set of images with their respective labels for training and evaluation purposes.


6. Bigram Language Model and Transformer Model

Top 10 rows of data for Bigram Language Model:

```
Input Sequence        Target Label
---------------------------------
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]      2
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]      3
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]      4
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]      5
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]      6
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]     7
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11]    8
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12]   9
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13]  10
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14] 11
```

Top 10 rows of data for Transformer Model:

```
Input Sequence                 Target Label
-------------------------------------------
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]     10
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]    11
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]   12
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]  13
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] 14
[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] 15
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] 16
[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] 17
[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] 18
[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] 19
```

In both cases, the input sequences are represented as a list of tokens, and the target label represents the next token in the sequence. These examples assume a fixed sequence length of 5 for the Bigram Language Model and 9 for the Transformer Model, but you can adjust the sequence length and actual tokens according to your specific task and dataset.


**Notes:** Please note that these examples are synthetic and simplified for demonstration purposes. In real-world scenarios, the data may have more features and a larger number of samples.

### 4. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

### 5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from torchvision import datasets, transforms

# Set random seed for reproducibility
torch.manual_seed(1337)

# Define the CNN architecture
class CNNModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CNNModel, self).__init__()

```

This example demonstrates how to build a simple CNN using PyTorch for image classification on the MNIST dataset. It includes loading the dataset, defining the CNN architecture, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

These examples should help you get started with building machine learning models using PyTorch for different tasks, including early stopping for better model generalization. Feel free to modify the code according to your specific requirements and datasets.

### 6. Bigram Language Model

Here's a simple example of building a Bigram Language Model using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define the Bigram Language Model class
class BigramLanguageModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size):
        super(BigramLanguageModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, vocab_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        embedded = self.embedding(x)
        logits = self.fc(embedded)
        return logits

# Define hyperparameters
vocab_size = 10000  # Vocabulary size
embedding_dim = 100  # Embedding dimension
learning_rate = 0.01
num_epochs = 10

# Create the Bigram Language Model instance
model = BigramLanguageModel(vocab_size)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    
    # Generate random input sequence (batch_size x sequence_length)
    input_sequence = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (batch_size, sequence_length))
    
    # Forward pass
    logits = model(input_sequence)
    
    # Generate target labels by shifting the input sequence
    targets = input_sequence[:, 1:].reshape(-1)
    
    # Compute the loss
    loss = criterion(logits.reshape(-1, vocab_size), targets)
    
    # Backward pass and optimization
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    # Print the loss
    print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item()}")

# Example usage of the trained model
input_sequence = torch.tensor([[1, 2]])  # Example input sequence
output_logits = model(input_sequence)
predicted_labels = torch.argmax(output_logits, dim=-1)
print("Predicted Labels:", predicted_labels)
```

In this example, we define a `BigramLanguageModel` class that extends `nn.Module`. It consists of an embedding layer followed by a linear layer. The model takes input sequences and predicts the next token based on the current token using a bigram approach.

During training, we generate random input sequences and perform forward and backward passes to optimize the model using the Cross Entropy Loss. We use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as the optimizer.

After training, we can use the trained model to make predictions by passing input sequences to the model and obtaining the predicted labels.

Note that in this example, you would need to replace `batch_size`, `sequence_length`, and adjust other parameters according to your specific task and dataset.



### 7. Transformer Model

Here's a simple example of building a Transformer model using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torch.nn.functional as F
from torch.nn import TransformerEncoder, TransformerEncoderLayer

# Define the Transformer model
class TransformerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embed_size, num_heads, hidden_size, num_layers):
        super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_size)
        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoding(embed_size)
        encoder_layers = TransformerEncoderLayer(embed_size, num_heads, hidden_size)
        self.transformer_encoder = TransformerEncoder(encoder_layers, num_layers)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(embed_size, vocab_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.embedding(x)
        x = self.pos_encoder(x)
        x = self.transformer_encoder(x)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

# Positional Encoding for the Transformer model
class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, max_seq_len=5000):
        super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.1)
        pe = torch.zeros(max_seq_len, embed_size)
        position = torch.arange(0, max_seq_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, embed_size, 2).float() * (-math.log(10000.0) / embed_size))
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        pe = pe.unsqueeze(0).transpose(0, 1)
        self.register_buffer('pe', pe)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x + self.pe[:x.size(0), :]
        return self.dropout(x)

# Set random seed for reproducibility
torch.manual_seed(1337)

# Define the hyperparameters
vocab_size = 10000
embed_size = 256
num_heads = 8
hidden_size = 512
num_layers = 6

# Create an instance of the Transformer model
model = TransformerModel(vocab_size, embed_size, num_heads, hidden_size, num_layers)

# Define the loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):  # Run for 10 epochs
    running_loss = 0.0
    for inputs, targets in train_data:  # Iterate over training data
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs.view(-1, vocab_size), targets.view(-1))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

        running_loss += loss.item()

    print(f'Epoch: {epoch + 1}, Loss: {running_loss / len(train_data)}')

print("Training finished!")
```

In this example, we define a TransformerModel class that extends nn.Module. The model consists of an embedding layer, positional encoding layer, Transformer encoder layer, and a fully connected layer for output. The PositionalEncoding class is used to provide positional information to the model. We set the hyperparameters for the model, create an instance of the Transformer model, and define the loss function (CrossEntropyLoss) and optimizer (Adam). The model is then trained using a training loop where inputs and targets are passed through the model, and gradients are computed and updated using backpropagation.

Note that this is a simplified example and may require modifications depending on your need.


## III. Activation functions and loss functions in neural networks

Here are some commonly used activation functions and loss functions in neural networks:

***Activation Functions:***

| Activation Function | Description                                                     | Usage                                   | Use Case                                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Sigmoid             | S-shaped curve mapping input to a range between 0 and 1         | `torch.sigmoid()` or `nn.Sigmoid()`     | Binary classification, probability estimation          |
| ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) | Returns 0 for negative inputs, input value for positive inputs | `F.relu()` or `nn.ReLU()`               | Hidden layers of deep networks, non-linearity          |
| Tanh                | S-shaped curve mapping input to a range between -1 and 1        | `torch.tanh()`                          | Hidden layers, normalization, zero-centered inputs     |

1. Sigmoid:
   - Description: The sigmoid function is an S-shaped curve that maps the input to a range between 0 and 1. It is commonly used as a non-linear activation function in binary classification problems.
   - Usage: `output = torch.sigmoid(input)`
   - Use Case: Binary classification problems where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability or a binary decision.

2. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):
   - Description: The ReLU function returns 0 for negative inputs and the input value itself for positive inputs. It is a widely used activation function that introduces non-linearity and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.
   - Usage: `output = F.relu(input)`
   - Use Case: Hidden layers of deep neural networks, especially in computer vision tasks.

3. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent):
   - Description: The tanh function is an S-shaped curve that maps the input to a range between -1 and 1. It is similar to the sigmoid function but symmetric around zero.
   - Usage: `output = torch.tanh(input)`
   - Use Case: Hidden layers of neural networks where inputs need to be normalized or centered around zero.

**Notes:** In addition to using `torch.sigmoid()` and `F.sigmoid()` for the sigmoid activation function, you can also use `nn.Sigmoid()` from the `torch.nn` module in PyTorch.

The `nn.Sigmoid()` is a module-based implementation of the sigmoid activation function. It is typically used when constructing neural network models using the `nn.Module` class in PyTorch. Here's an example:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

input = torch.randn(10)  # Example input tensor

# Using nn.Sigmoid()
sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
output = sigmoid(input)
```

In this example, `nn.Sigmoid()` is instantiated as an object, and then the `input` tensor is passed through the `sigmoid` object, which applies the sigmoid activation function to the input.

Similarly, you can use other activation functions such as `nn.ReLU()`, `nn.Tanh()`, and more from the `nn` module when defining neural network models.

Using `nn.Sigmoid()` provides a convenient way to incorporate the sigmoid activation function as a module within a larger neural network architecture, allowing for easier model construction and parameter management.


***Loss Functions:***

| Loss Function                   | Description                                                     | Usage                                          | Use Case                                                     |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Binary Cross Entropy Loss       | Measures dissimilarity for binary classification problems        | `F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits()`         | Binary classification, probability estimation               |
| Categorical Cross Entropy Loss  | Measures dissimilarity for multi-class classification problems   | `F.cross_entropy()`                            | Multi-class classification, mutually exclusive classes      |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss   | Measures average squared difference for regression problems      | `F.mse_loss()` or `nn.MSELoss()`               | Regression, continuous target values                        |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Loss  | Measures average absolute difference for regression problems     | `F.l1_loss()` or `nn.L1Loss()`                 | Regression, less sensitive to outliers                       |

1. Binary Cross Entropy Loss:
   - Description: Binary cross entropy loss measures the dissimilarity between predicted and target values for binary classification problems. It is commonly used when the output is a single value representing the probability of a binary class.
   - Usage: `loss = F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits(input, target)`
   - Use Case: Binary classification problems where the output is a probability between 0 and 1.

2. Categorical Cross Entropy Loss:
   - Description: Categorical cross entropy loss is used for multi-class classification problems. It measures the dissimilarity between predicted and target probability distributions over multiple classes.
   - Usage: `loss = F.cross_entropy(input, target)`
   - Use Case: Multi-class classification problems with mutually exclusive classes.

3. Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss:
   - Description: MSE loss calculates the average squared difference between predicted and target values. It is commonly used for regression problems.
   - Usage: `loss = F.mse_loss(input, target)`
   - Use Case: Regression problems where the output is a continuous value.

4. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Loss:
   - Description: MAE loss computes the average absolute difference between predicted and target values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE loss.
   - Usage: `loss = F.l1_loss(input, target)`
   - Use Case: Regression problems where the output is a continuous value and outliers should be given less weight.

These are just a few examples of commonly used activation and loss functions in neural networks. The choice of activation and loss functions depends on the nature of the problem, the type of data, and the desired behavior of the model.


## IV. optimizers in neural networks

It's important to note that the popularity of optimizers can vary depending on the specific task, dataset, and research trends. The optimizers listed above are widely used and have been shown to work well in various scenarios. However, the choice of optimizer ultimately depends on experimentation and finding the one that suits your specific problem and model architecture.


## V. How to improve ML model

Improving an ML model involves various strategies and techniques. Here are some key areas to focus on for making your ML model better:

1. Data preprocessing: Ensure that your data is properly preprocessed. This may involve steps like cleaning the data, handling missing values, scaling or normalizing features, and handling categorical variables appropriately.

2. Feature engineering: Create informative and relevant features that can improve the model's performance. This may involve domain-specific knowledge, transformations, aggregations, or interactions between variables.

3. Model selection: Explore different types of ML models suitable for your problem, such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, etc. Experiment with different architectures and algorithms to find the one that performs best for your specific task.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model. Hyperparameters control the behavior and performance of the model, such as learning rate, regularization strength, number of layers, etc. Use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.

5. Regularization techniques: Apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and batch normalization.

6. Model ensembling: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve performance. Ensembling methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking can help in reducing errors and increasing accuracy.

7. Cross-validation: Use cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance and generalization ability. This helps in estimating how well the model will perform on unseen data and avoids overfitting.

8. Model evaluation metrics: Select appropriate evaluation metrics that align with your problem. For classification tasks, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used. For regression tasks, metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) are often used. Choose the metrics that are most meaningful for your specific problem.

9. Regular monitoring and maintenance: Continuously monitor your model's performance in production. Collect feedback, analyze model errors, and retrain the model periodically to keep it up to date with the evolving data.

By iterating and experimenting with these aspects, you can gradually improve your ML model's performance. Keep in mind that the specific techniques and parameters to adjust will depend on the nature of your problem, the dataset, and the chosen ML algorithm.


Twisting parameters like batch size, training epoch, hidden layers, and other hyperparameters can indeed have a significant impact on the performance of your ML model. Here's how each parameter can be tweaked and the potential effects:

1. Batch size: The batch size determines the number of samples processed in each iteration during training. Increasing the batch size can lead to faster training as more samples are processed in parallel. However, larger batch sizes require more memory, and excessively large batch sizes can lead to suboptimal generalization. It's recommended to experiment with different batch sizes to find the right balance between speed and performance.

2. Training epoch: The number of training epochs determines how many times the model iterates over the entire training dataset. Increasing the number of epochs allows the model to see the data more times, potentially improving performance. However, training for too many epochs can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specific to the training data. It's important to monitor the model's performance on a separate validation set and stop training when the performance plateaus.

3. Hidden layers: The number of hidden layers in a neural network architecture determines the depth of the model. Adding more hidden layers can increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns in the data. However, deeper models are more prone to overfitting, especially when the training data is limited. It's advisable to start with a simple architecture and gradually increase the depth if needed, while monitoring the model's performance and generalization.

4. Learning rate: The learning rate controls the step size in the optimization process. It determines how quickly the model learns from the gradients and updates the model's parameters. Choosing the right learning rate is crucial as a high learning rate can cause unstable training or overshooting, while a low learning rate can result in slow convergence. It's common to use techniques like learning rate scheduling or adaptive optimization algorithms (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.

5. Regularization: Regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and batch normalization can help in reducing overfitting. These techniques introduce constraints or noise to the model during training, encouraging generalization. The regularization strength or dropout rate can be adjusted to control the amount of regularization applied.

It's important to note that parameter tuning is a trial-and-error process, and the optimal values may vary depending on the dataset and the specific problem. It's recommended to conduct systematic experiments by trying different parameter settings and evaluating the model's performance on validation data. Techniques like grid search or random search can be used to automate the parameter tuning process and find the optimal combination of parameters.



Twisting parameters like batch size, training epochs, and hidden layers can have a significant impact on the performance of your ML model. Here's an example code snippet in PyTorch that demonstrates how to experiment with these parameters:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define your model architecture
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super(MyModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Define your training loop
def train_model(model, train_data, train_labels, batch_size, num_epochs):
    criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

    num_samples = train_data.size(0)
    num_batches = num_samples // batch_size

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        running_loss = 0.0
        for batch_idx in range(num_batches):
            start_idx = batch_idx * batch_size
            end_idx = start_idx + batch_size

            inputs = train_data[start_idx:end_idx]
            labels = train_labels[start_idx:end_idx]

            optimizer.zero_grad()
            outputs = model(inputs)
            loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

            running_loss += loss.item()

        epoch_loss = running_loss / num_batches
        print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs}, Loss: {epoch_loss}")

# Example usage
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 2
batch_size = 32
num_epochs = 10

# Generate some random training data and labels
train_data = torch.randn(1000, input_size)
train_labels = torch.randint(0, output_size, (1000,))

# Create an instance of your model
model = MyModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)

# Train the model with different parameters
train_model(model, train_data, train_labels, batch_size, num_epochs)
```

In this example, you can experiment by changing the values of `batch_size`, `num_epochs`, `hidden_size`, and observe how it affects the training process and the model's performance. Adjusting these parameters allows you to find the optimal configuration that yields the best results for your specific task.
